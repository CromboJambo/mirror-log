`mirror-log` is a local-first event log for capturing notes, commands, snippets, and other context you do not want to lose. Persisted events live in SQLite. Staged events live as JSON files in `staging/` until you review or process them.

Version `0.1.9` reflects the current shipped behavior: a lean SQLite core, staging helpers for review-oriented workflows, an attention/decay layer, and optional embedding or inference integrations behind Cargo features.

## What It Does

- Persists events to SQLite with UUIDs, timestamps, hashes, and chunk records
- Stages reviewable JSON events in `staging/`
- Searches full events and chunked content
- Tracks duplicates by `content_hash`
- Exposes attention and decay views over persisted events
- Supports optional embeddings, inference backends, iteration tables, and clipboard ingestion

## Current Workflow

```bash
# Stage a single event as JSON in ./staging
mirror-log add "Overhead allocation needs review" --source journal

# Stage a file as JSON in ./staging
mirror-log add-file notes.md --source meetings

# Persist stdin events to SQLite in batches, then also write staged copies
cat ideas.txt | mirror-log stdin --source ideas

# Review staged events
mirror-log review

# Detect simple patterns from staged events
mirror-log infer

# Render staged events back out
mirror-log regenerate --output human.md

# Query persisted events
mirror-log show --last 10
mirror-log search "allocation"
mirror-log search "allocation" --chunks
mirror-log get <event-id>

# Database and integrity views
mirror-log stats
mirror-log info
mirror-log verify

# Attention layer
mirror-log attention
mirror-log attention --flagged
mirror-log attention --stats
mirror-log add-to-attention <event-id>
```

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CromboJambo/mirror-log
cd mirror-log
cargo build --release

# Optional feature paths
cargo build --release --features embedding
cargo build --release --features inference
cargo build --release --features clipboard

# Or install locally
cargo install --path .
```

The binary is written to `target/release/mirror-log`.

## Storage Model

Persisted log data lives in `mirror.db` by default.

- `events` stores the canonical persisted event log
- `chunks` stores chunked slices for large content and chunk search
- `decay` and `shadow_state` support attention/visibility behavior
- `event_embeddings`, `event_tags`, `event_links`, and iteration tables support enrichment-oriented workflows

Staged data is separate from the persisted log.

- `add` and `add-file` write `StagedEvent` JSON files to `staging/`
- `stdin` currently persists events to SQLite first and then emits staged copies for review
- Persisted events are append-only; staged files are a working set

## Features

The default build is intentionally lean.

- `embedding`: tokenizers-backed embedding generation and similarity search
- `inference`: HTTP inference backend support
- `iteration`: iteration query and type exports
- `clipboard`: clipboard watcher support

Attention and staging are part of the current default build, not separate feature flags.

## Direct SQLite Access

```sql
SELECT datetime(timestamp, 'unixepoch'), source, content
FROM events
ORDER BY timestamp DESC
LIMIT 10;

SELECT source, COUNT(*)
FROM events
GROUP BY source
ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC;

SELECT COUNT(*) AS total,
       COUNT(DISTINCT content_hash) AS unique_events
FROM events;
```

## Development

```bash
cargo fmt
cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
cargo test
```

Dependency audit helpers:

```bash
scripts/dep-audit.sh
scripts/dep-audit.sh --features embedding
scripts/log-dep-audit.sh
scripts/log-dep-audit-matrix.sh
```
